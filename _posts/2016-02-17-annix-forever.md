description: "When Annix's debut album 'Inception' came out back in 2013 it was one of the most hotly tipped album releases on the dnb calendar. Now Cheltenham duo Konichi and Decimal Bass return with a second album 'Forever' - which sees them a little older, wiser, but still as darn well talented."
