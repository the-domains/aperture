Hot on the heels of handing over the controls to Critical Music to give our new VOID soundsystem a proper work out, we bring you something a little different. Dancefloor favourites Annix, the duo made up of Konichi & Decimal Bass, will be joined on the one's and two's by special guest TI to launch their album "Forever". This will sell out, don't sleep on the half price early birds.
